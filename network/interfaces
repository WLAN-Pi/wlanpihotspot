# Wireless adapter #1
# Armbian ships with network-manager installed by default. To save you time
# and hassles consider using 'sudo nmtui' instead of configuring Wi-Fi settings
# manually. The below lines are only meant as an example how configuration could
# be done in an anachronistic way:
#
allow-hotplug wlan0
#iface wlan0 inet dhcp
iface wlan0 inet static
address 192.168.88.1
netmask 255.255.255.0
#gateway 192.168.0.1
dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4
#   wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
# Disable power saving on compatible chipsets (prevents SSH/connection dropouts over WiFi)
#wireless-mode Monitor
#wireless-power off
hostapd /etc/hostapd.conf

# USB virtual ethernet interface
auto usb0
iface usb0 inet static
address 192.168.42.1
subnet 255.255.255.0

# Wired ethernet
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp
