INSTALL.txt
==========

To provide a test hotspot using the WLANPi, you will need:

 - a supported wireless adapter plugged in to one USB port of the WLANPi (e.g. CF-912ac)
 - a WLANPi unit

To install the required files, obtain the gzipped archive file in the "bundle" directory of the project github repo (https://github.com/WLAN-Pi/wlanpi-hotspot)

Copy the wifi-hotspot gzipped archive to the WLANPi into the /etc directory of the WLANPI. Extract the files from the archive using
the command:

 sudo tar xvfz wlanpihostpot-v0.02.tar.gz
 
Installation is now complete. If you are using the native WLANPi front panel menu system to flip modes (which is available from image ver v1.7 & highly recommended!) and activate the hotspot, you do not need to do anything else.

To flip in to the hotspot mode via the CLI, change to the newly created directory /etc/wlanpihotspot:

 cd /etc/wlanpihotspot

Flip the WLANPi in to hotspot mode:

 sudo ./hotspot_switcher on

At this point, the WLANPi will reboot. Following the reboot, an SSID of wlanpi_hotspot will be available on channel 36. Join the SSID and use the PSK: wifipros.

Once you have joined the SSID, you will have access to the WLANPi and can access features such as the speedtest using a browser at : http://192.168.88.1/

To switch out of hotspot mode, SSH to it  and run the command: sudo /etc/wlanpihotspot/hotspot_switcher off

*** Note: The front panel menu system available from image version v1.7 is a much better option for flipping WLANPi modes ***
